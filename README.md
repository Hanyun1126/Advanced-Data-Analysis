This is a capstone project associated with Columbia University.

## Introduction for this project
We are trying to understand the customer personality. Customer personality analysis is an essential tool that enables businesses to gain a closer insight of their ideal
customers. By analyzing the specific needs and behaviors of different customer segments,
companies can improve their products and services accordingly. This not only enhances cus-
tomer satisfaction but also helps businesses build their marketing strategies more effectively.
